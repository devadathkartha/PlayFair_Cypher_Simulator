# PlayFair_Cypher_Simulator
This repository contains the source code for our PlayFair Cypher Simulator project.
Cryptography : 
The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
Encryption Technique :
We have used the standard cryptographic technique to encode the algorithm. We have added additional functionality to allow for the change of the letter that you may want to replace and that you want to replace that letter with. We have also added history based functionality that allows the user to view the history of the texts that they have asked for encryption or decryption and the relevant results.
We have attached screenshots from the webapp that we have built.
